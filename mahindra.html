        <h3>Mahindra and Mahindra, the homegrown UV specialist, has been fairing pretty well in the MPV and SUV segments of the country. While not as popular as Maruti and Hyundai, it’s surely a force to reckon with in Tier II and Tier III markets of the country. Its models like the Bolero, Scorpio and XUV500 has been well-received by the Indian audience. A huge reason for this is that these models have been developed keeping the Indian market in mind and are further supported by easy maintenance and the company’s wide-spread service network.</h3>
        <h3>In the coming times, the company is about to launch a slew of new models, including new generation models of the XUV500, Bolero and Scorpio. Other than this, the company will even introduce an electric version of the XUV300 to cash in on the fast-growing EV trend. Also, the company will come up with new-gen platforms and engines in accordance with the upcoming stricter emission and safety norms. All these developments should help the carmaker bolster its place in the market.

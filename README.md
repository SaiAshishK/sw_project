# Project 0

As part of this project, I have created a website using different tags and css selectors,etc

In this, I have created a website which gives us information about the leading car manufacturers and their products. In the home page, i have created a form which needs to be submitted in 
order to go the next page. The next page consists of the top 4 manufacturers in India with their images. Clicking any of them will lead to another page in which the detailed description 
on the selected manufacturer as well as their products are mentioned with links that lead to the company's official website and the model that has been chosen.
Every page leads to either the first page or the second page. The second page leads to all the pages.

        <h3>Hyundai, the Korean carmaker giant, started its Indian innings with the launch of the Santro in the late 90s. Next, the tallboy was followed by the Accent and even premium products in the form of Tucson, Sonata and Terracan. Today, the carmaker has a wide lineup that ranges from the second-gen Santro to the Elantra and the third-gen Tucson. Right now, it is the second most popular carmaker in the country, with a market share of about 18 percent. While at a distant second from Maruti Suzuki, the carmaker definitely enjoys a huge edge over all other carmakers.</h3>
        <h3>In the coming times, Hyundai will be seen launching BSVI-compliant versions of its petrol and diesel engines. Moreover, it will also release more electric products after seeing the great response that Kona has received from the Indian car buying lot. Hyundai will even focus to further bolster its sales and service network by adding more touchpoints to its already strong network. That said, the carmaker doesn’t look likely to be able to close in on the gap between Maruti’s and its own sales performance anytime soon.</h3>
        <h3>Cars are divided based on their bodytype. </h3>

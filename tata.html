        <h1>Tata Motors</h1>

        <h3>Tata Motors, in recent years, has even managed to make some place for itself in the highly competitive small car segment with the Tiago. On the other hand, the Safari Storme, its small SUV, has been losing out on popularity. Thankfully, however, the Harrier has been received well in the market and is likely to help the carmaker stay afloat in the SUV segment. The same can be said for the Nexon, which takes on some much-loved models like the Maruti Vitara Brezza and Hyundai Venue.</h3>
        <h3>In the coming times, the carmaker will introduce the Altroz, a new premium hatchback that will rival Maruti Baleno and Hyundai Elite i20. The new model will be followed by the Nexon EV and Gravitas, with the latter being the much-awaited 7-seater version of the Harrier. Thanks to a strong R&D and design team, the latest crop of Tata vehicles are world-class products that have a high appeal. Keeping that in mind, the future seems prosperous for our homegrown manufacturer.</h3>
        <h3>Cars are divided based on their bodytype. </h3>
